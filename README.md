# Web Application Functionality Security Test Cases and Vulnerability #
Description

Web Application Functionality Security Testing specifically focuses on ensuring that the application's functionalities are not vulnerable to security threats. While some overlap exists with general security testing, the emphasis here is on the functionality aspects. I personally prefer to start with the Black-Box and Grey-Box testing approach where I try to enumerate banner information, some basic or I can say network-level findings that can be found using any automated tool as well as manually such as.

1.Registration Functionality:

1.Username enumeration via verbose failure messages
2.No confirmed password functionality
3.No mobile number verification process
4.No email verification process/No account verification process
5.Weak Security Question/Answer
6.No multi-factor authentication enables option
7.No term and condition checkbox during registration
8.Nonunique usernames/Predictable usernames
9.Lack of User Input Validation (Max Length not Implemented)
10.SQL Injection
11.HTML Injection
12.Stored XSS

1.Input Validation
Register using special characters in the username, email, or password fields to check for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Input overly long strings into the fields to check for buffer overflow.
Input HTML or JavaScript snippets to test for cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

2.Account Enumeration
Observe system's response to registering with an already registered email or username. It shouldn't indicate clearly whether an email or username is registered (to prevent user enumeration).

3.Rate Limiting/Brute Force
Try to register multiple times in quick succession to ensure rate limiting is in place.
Automated registration attempts to ensure CAPTCHA or similar anti-bot mechanisms are in place.

4.Password Policy
Attempt to register with weak passwords (like "password", "123456", etc.) to check password strength policies.
Check if there's a mechanism that ensures password complexity (mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).

5.Data Transmission Security

Ensure that the registration page is using HTTPS, ensuring data is encrypted during transmission.
Intercept the registration request using a proxy tool (like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP) and verify if the data (especially the password) is sent in clear text.

6.Data Storage Security
If possible, check how the password is stored in the database. It should be hashed (and ideally salted).

7.Error Handling
Ensure that detailed system errors (like stack traces) are not shown to the user. They should see generic error messages instead.

8.CAPTCHA
Ensure a CAPTCHA is in place and can't be bypassed easily.
Check if the CAPTCHA expires after a certain time or after a few unsuccessful attempts.

9.Account Verification
Ensure that a user must verify their email address (or other contact method) before the registration is complete.
Check if the verification link/token expires after a certain time.

10.Session Management
Once registered and if the user is logged in immediately, ensure they receive a unique session ID and that this ID isn't easily guessable.

11.Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
If MFA is an option, ensure that it's working correctly and can't be bypassed.

12.Logging and Monitoring
Check if multiple registration failures are being logged.
Ensure that critical actions (like changing email/password) during or post-registration are logged.

13.Redirects and Forwards
Check for unvalidated redirects and forwards after registration. Attackers might exploit this to redirect users to malicious sites.

14.Third-party Integrations
If registration can be done using third-party identities (like "Login with Google" or "Login with Facebook"), ensure that these integrations are secure and tokens aren't exposed.

15.Unused Features/Endpoints
Make sure there aren't any unused registration endpoints or features that can be exploited.

16.Denial of Service
Try flooding the registration form with requests to see if it can be used for DoS attacks.

17.Social Engineering
Assess any security questions or backup methods used for account recovery to ensure they arenâ€™t easily guessable or discoverable through social engineering.

2.Account Enumeration:
Observe system's response to entering non-existent usernames or wrong passwords. It shouldn't indicate whether a particular user exists or not.

3.Brute Force Attacks:
Attempt to login multiple times with different password combinations to ensure there are measures to prevent brute force attacks, like account lockouts or CAPTCHAs.

4.Session Management:
Once logged in, ensure the application assigns a unique session ID. Test if manually changing the session ID allows access to another user's session.
Ensure the session expires after a period of inactivity.

5.Password Policy Enforcement:
Attempt multiple incorrect passwords and observe system behavior (e.g., does it lock out after 'n' attempts?).

6.Data Transmission Security:
Ensure the login page is secured with HTTPS, indicating data is encrypted during transmission.
Intercept the login request using tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP and verify if the data (especially passwords) is sent in clear text.

11.Account Recovery:
Test the account/password recovery process. Ensure that security questions (if used) aren't trivial.
Ensure that reset tokens sent via email or other methods expire after a certain period or after being used.

12.Logging and Monitoring:
Ensure login failures are logged with relevant details (e.g., IP address, timestamp).
Multiple failed login attempts from the same IP in a short period should raise alerts.

13.Test for Auto-fill Browsers Feature:
Ensure that sensitive fields like passwords are not easily auto-filled without user confirmation.

14.Check for Session Fixation:
Log into the application and note down the session cookie. Log out and then use the same cookie to access the application. The application should not allow access.

15.Logout Functionality:
After logging out, ensure that the user's session is terminated and cannot be reused.

16.Third-party Integrations:
If login can be done using third-party services (like "Login with Google" or "Login with Facebook"), ensure these integrations are secure.
T
17.esting for Default Credentials:
Check if the application has any default usernames and passwords set up (e.g., admin/admin) and ensure they are changed or disabled in production environments.

18.Check for Denial of Service (DoS):
Attempt to flood the login form with numerous requests in a short period and observe the application's behavior.

17.Cross-Site Request Forgery(CSRF)

1.Token Generation and Expiry:
Ensure the reset token/link is unique and random, and can't be easily guessed or brute-forced.
Check if the token expires after a certain period.
Ensure the token is invalidated after use.

2.Token Transmission Security:
Ensure that the reset token/link is transmitted securely (e.g., via HTTPS if sent through a link in an email).

3.Brute Force Attacks:
Try brute-forcing the reset token to see if there's any rate limiting or lockout mechanisms in place.

4.Input Validation on Reset Form:
Test for SQL injection, XSS, and buffer overflow vulnerabilities on the password reset input fields.

5.Account Enumeration:
Observe the application's response when requesting a password reset for both existing and non-existing accounts. The response shouldn't reveal whether an email is associated with an account in the system.

6.Session Management after Password Reset:
After a successful password reset, ensure that all active sessions for the user are terminated, requiring re-login with the new password.

7.Email Notification:
When a password reset request is made, the account owner should receive an email notification, even if the request was not initiated by them. This acts as an alert for potential unauthorized reset attempts.

8.Password Policy Enforcement:
Ensure the new password adheres to the application's password policy in terms of length, complexity, etc.

9.Direct Access to Reset Page:
Try accessing the password reset page directly without a valid token to ensure it's not accessible.

10.Resending Password Reset Link:
Request password reset multiple times. Check if the application invalidates the older links/tokens when a new one is generated.

11.Use of Captcha:
Ensure CAPTCHA or similar anti-bot mechanisms are in place to prevent automated attacks on the password reset page.

12.Logging and Monitoring:
Ensure that password reset attempts, both successful and unsuccessful, are logged with relevant details like IP address, timestamp, and user-agent.

13.Error Handling:
Observe the error messages displayed for invalid tokens, expired tokens, etc. The messages shouldn't reveal too much about the system's internal workings or database details.

14.Two-factor or Multi-factor Authentication:
If the user has MFA enabled, ensure the password reset process incorporates MFA verification.

15.Testing with Different User Roles:
If the application has different user roles (e.g., user, admin), test the reset functionality for each role to ensure there are no discrepancies in the process or potential vulnerabilities specific to a role.

16.Backend Verification:
Check how the reset tokens are stored in the backend. They should be stored securely (hashed) or not stored at all.

17.Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):
Ensure the password reset functionality is protected against CSRF attacks.

18.Password History Check:
After resetting, the application should not allow the use of the last 'n' passwords used by the user.
